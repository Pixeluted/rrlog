A proof-of-concept ruleset logger for Roblox's [YARA](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) memory scans. This project goes with my [reversal](http://blog.nestra.tech/everyones-detected-roblox-part-i-yara-memory-scanning-2) of Roblox's unsigned executable memory detection mechanism powered by custom YARA rulesets.
